    <string name="gdg_description_long">GDGs are local groups of developers who are specifically interested in Google
        products and APIs. Each local group is called a GDG chapter and can host a variety of technical activities for
        developers - from just a few people getting together to watch our latest videos, to large gatherings with demos
        and tech talks, to hackathons. Google Developers supports and recognizes GDG chapters, but doesn’t own or manage
        them.
